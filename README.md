### Powershell Labs

###### Course Description
This course introduces the tools and techniques of systems programming.  We begin by exploring the UNIX/Linux/Ubuntu world including syscall programming (input/output programming, process management, dynamic memory management, run-time scheduling), UNIX commands, shell programming and libraries. Then we cover generic system programming tools (loaders, debuggers, library maintainers, archivers, etc.). Then we give an overview of compilers, introducing the main types of programming languages (procedural, non-procedural, functional, interpretive). Next is a quick coverage of parsing (using YACC and Lex or ANTLR). The final section bookends the UNIX beginning by examining the Windows system programming world, including basic syscalls (I/O programming, dynamic exception handling, dynamic memory management, run-time process and threads management, run-time scheduling, IPC), power shell and systems tuning.
